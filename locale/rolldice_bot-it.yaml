  Hi, welcome on the telgram bot to roll dices!

  This bot is meant to be to help rpg players to roll dice with many options.

  To roll dices you can use the command /roll followed by the roll you want to perform.
  For example to roll 3d6 you will write "/roll 3d6"... easy!

  After the dice type you can add some bonus, like +3, -2, or even /2 or *2,
  of course you can combine multiple bonuses.

  Some options are going to be implemented, the option will follow the syntax
  from roll20 (https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference#Rerolling_Dice).
